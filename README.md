### Project Overview
---

This project seeks to explores the health implications of smoking and various health parameters across different demographics. By analysing this data, we hope to establish trends, make key decisions based on the available data and gain in-depth understanding of the data.

### Data Source

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is "smoking_health_data.csv" file, obtained from kaggle which gives detailed description of each column and its relevance to the study.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

This focuses on drawing useful insights from the data and making the findings appealing for targeted public health interventions to reduce smoking rates and mitigate its adverse health effects. It includes;
1. Differences in sex of an individual can affect smoking pattern.
2. Age of the individual and it's influence on smoking habits.
3. Correlation of smoking on health parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.


### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. Males were predominately smokers than females.
2. The aged, 50+ yrs age recorded less smoking activities comparatively to their younger counterpart.
3. It can be seen that smoking causes increased in blood pressure but there are many other contributing factors as visible in non-smokers blood pressure values. 
4. Cholesterol level of smokers are high, although non-smokers are at risk due to other factors.


### Recommendations

Following the analysis of the data to establish the relationship between smoking and other health variables, we can make the these recommendations to public health officials, healthcare providers, policymakers, and community organizations.
1. Promote smoking cessation programs that are tailored to different age groups and genders, specifically males and those aged 50+.
2. Creating awareness campaigns highlighting the health risks associated with smoking, focusing on the impact on heart rate, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.


### Limitations

I had to fill up all null values with zeros, as opposed to removing them because it would have greatly affected the precise details of my analysis
